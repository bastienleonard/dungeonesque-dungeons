** TODO Remove ~_props~
** TODO Remove this file
** TODO Tweak item counts
** TODO Address TODO and FIXME comments
   Add a hook to prevent from committing them?
** TODO Test with the lowest resolution used by Steam users
   - ~love.window.setFullscreen(not love.window.getFullscreen())~: probably
     need to set window size for better experience


* Gameplay

** TODO Add the ability to skip a turn
** TODO Improve arrows
   The player should only be able to select a direction.
** TODO Light simulation


* UI

** TODO Use buttons in the ~DeathScreen~ menu
** TODO Show range of weapons
** TODO Make sure we don't pass floats where integers give better rendering
   E.g. due to UI scaling.
** TODO Main menu
** TODO Settings screen
** TODO Customize the error handler further

  - Improve the design
  - Mention some way of contacting us


* Technical

** TODO Release for macOS
** TODO Check license notice in scripts and any other missing files
** TODO Ignore unstaged code in checks
** TODO ~Health~: remove ~_hp~ suffix
** TODO Lua interpreter prompt
** TODO Consider caching common padding/margin instances
** TODO Cache quads
** TODO Hook to prevent from committing ~globals.DEBUG = true~
** TODO Consider making the camera coordinates the center of the screen
** TODO Map tiles memory layout

  Benchmark row-col vs col-row order. Make sure we access elements linearly.

** TODO Run Git hooks on CI


* Level generation

** TODO Introduce randomess in the number of  items per level
** TODO Clean up ~map_generator~
** TODO Make levels larger as time goes on
** TODO Add more decoration flavor
   - Knight rooms: beds, bed tables, chests
   - Libraries/wizard rooms
   - Dungeons: bars, prisonners
   - Storage/treasure rooms
   - Luxurious "boss" room, with fancy equipment or money


* Misc

** TODO Release an AppImage file for Linux
** TODO Try rendering without borders between tiles
** TODO Try to render items on top of tile "icons"
** TODO It seems possible to appear on a tile that contains an item

  The player then starts the level with the item picked up. That's confusing.

** TODO Make map generation uniform

  Make sure that items/decorations/etc. are distributed uniformly among
  tiles. Currently, what happens instead is that each room has the same
  probability of being picked for a e.g. decoration. This means that tiles in a
  small room have the same probability of being as the tiles of a large room.

** TODO Test on an azerty layout
** TODO Alt-tab doesn't work under Wine


* AI

** TODO Use proper path-finding
** TODO Prevent camping

   When an enemy is attacked, he should always know the position of the
   attacker and be able to go towards him. Ideally, this would be fixed at the
   FOV level.
